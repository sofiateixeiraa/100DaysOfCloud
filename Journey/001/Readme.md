# Terraform Basics

## Introduction

Prior to this challenge, I already had some Kubernetes basic training, so I decided to start with some Terraform Basics to dive into Infrastructure as a Code.
Using AWS as Cloud Provider, I dealt with IAM, EC2 instances, S3 buckets, VPC, Subnet and RDS.

## Prerequisite

Install [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) <br/>
AWS Free Tier Account

## Cloud Research

I searched every Terraform code on [this](https://registry.terraform.io/) website.

## Try yourself

### Step 1 — Terraform Installation

### Step 2 — AWS IAM - Create User

It's important to do this step so you have the access_key and secret_key field.

### Step 3 — AWS EC2 instance

### Step 4 — AWS 2nd EC2 instance

### Step 5 — S3 Bucket

### Step 6 — AWS VPC

### Step 7 — AWS Subnet

### Step 8 — AWS RDS
